			<h2>The Computer Vault</h2>
			<p>In addition to my main systems that I use to get work done, I also collect older laptops and restore them as a hobby. Some of the more interesting systems are listed below.</p>

					<b>"The Monolith"</b>
					<p>A self-built, high-performance desktop that's been constantly evolving since its inception in 2016. Every component has been upgraded at some point or another to make it the monster it is today. It dual boots Windows and Linux Mint, and is my main machine when I'm not out and about.</p>
					<p>Specs: Ryzen 5 3600, RTX 3070 Ti, 16gb RAM, 1tb SSD, 4tb HDD</p>

					<b>2021 Apple MacBook Pro 16" "Vehra"</b>
					<p>My daily driver, chosen for its long-lasting battery life and excellent construction. Apple may be a divisive brand, but they certainly know how to build a premium-feeling laptop. Now, if only they were more repairable...</p>
					<p>Specs: Apple M1 Pro, 16gb RAM, 512gb SSD</p>

					<b>Apple PowerBook G4 Titanium "Titanius"</b>
					<p>A machine far ahead of its time, this eBay find is in remarkably good shape for its age. Minus a few minor scratches on the lid, it looks mint.</p>
					<p>Specs: 1.0 GHz PowerPC G4, ATI Mobility 9000, 1gb RAM, 80gb HDD</p>

					<b>2020 Asus Zephyrus G14 "Jade"</b>
					<p>My former daily driver. It's since been succeeded by the 16" MacBook Pro for day-to-day use, but I still break it out periodically to play Windows games. It is remarkably powerful for its small form factor.</p>
					<p>Specs: Ryzen 9 4900HS, RTX 2060 Max-Q, 16gb RAM, 1TB SSD</p>

					<b>Dell XPS M170 "The Pegasus Project"</b>
					<p>I picked this computer up and refurbished it as a tribute to Stargate SG-1, a show in which it was prominently featured. It was in total disrepair and required a total restoration and many new components to bring back to life.</p>
					<p>Specs: Pentium M 780, GeForce Go 7800 GTX, 2gb RAM, 120gb SSD</p>
